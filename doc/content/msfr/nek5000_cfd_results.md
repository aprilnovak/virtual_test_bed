# MSFR Nek5000 CFD Results

The steady-state solutions of velocity and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) field
in the MSFR core from the 2-D axisymmetric RANS case are shown
below.

It is noticed that the velocity magnitude is higher in the peripheral
region compared to core center, which is related to the velocity
boundary condition given at the inlet. As for the TKE field,
the regions of high  TKE value indicate strong local flow mixing.
A velocity field with arrows is shown in [msfr_vel_vector] to illustrate
the velocity directions and magnitudes of specific locations inside the core.

!alert note
It has been noticed that the flow field solutions are sensitive to the
inlet boundary conditions. The results shown above are the steady-state
solutions with a constant inlet velocity, which is not necessarily the case
in the actual MSFR. Additional studies are being conducted to reproduce the
realistic inlet BC, which will help further improve the results.
